## 3.6.0 (November 14th, 2017)

This release adds two major enhancements, upgrades to Go 1.9 and Consul 1.0.0 as
well as signal events.

We've added a new event trigger to ContainerPilot. You can now send a UNIX
signal into a `containerpilot` process and have it trigger a custom job. Signal
based jobs can trigger on either `SIGHUP` or `SIGUSR2`.

FEATURES:

- Upgraded to Go 1.9 for building ContainerPilot (#519)
- Upgraded to Consul 1.0.0 for our testing infrastructure and target Consul
  version (#519)
- Signal events which allow a job to trigger on a UNIX signal (#513)

## 3.5.0 (October 13th, 2017)

The big change in this release for ContainerPilot is a refactoring of how the
app shuts down. We're now using the Go context package throughout the entire
application. Many of the race conditions and timing issues that occurred on
global shutdown should now be removed.

FEATURES:

- Log the pid of every job in a logger field (#497)

BUG FIXES:

- Refactor away EventHandler into separate pub/sub interfaces (#476)
- Migrate from deprecated Consul API call PassTTL to UpdateTTL (#515)
